# Required packages
In R, *Packages* are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. In order to execute the code, some packages are required and must be downloaded, installed and loaded prior to running the code.

The required packages are:

- *Hmisc*
- *RSQLite*
- *sqldf*
- *xlsx*

To install any package, you can use the built-in function:

    install.packages(<package_name>)

Or, if you decided to install RStudio, this IDE provides easy tool to automatically download and install multiple packages at the same time. Under the Packages tab (bottom-right panel), you can see all your installed packages. There, you can use the "Install package" button to download and install the required packages. Figure \@ref(fig:installPack) image presents this dialog.

```{r installPack, fig.cap='Install package dialog', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center',echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Install_package_tool.jpg")
```
