## Multiple folder source

Due to project organization, the user might requiered to use multiple folders as data sources. Therefore, the user is encorage to create their own copy of *MARA_ac_protocol.R* to process multiple folders. However, the user can also refer to *MARA_ac_protocol_multiple_folders.R* to process multiple files located in different folders (but all of them should share the same folder root).

The user only requires to specify the root folder as the `inputdir` parameter in the  *MARA_ac_protocol_multiple_folders.R* R script.

```{r,eval=F}
main <- function(){
  inputdir <- "E:\\MUEVETE ESCOLAR"
  outputdir <- ".\\output"
  outputfile <- paste("COL MUEVETE",as.Date(Sys.time()),".csv", sep="")
  ...
}
```
